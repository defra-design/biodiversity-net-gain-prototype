        <li>We understand the Local Planning Authorities (LPA) data needs sufficiently for them to use the register when assessing gain plans.</li>
        <li>LPA's will want to search by unique ref.</li>
        <li>Members of the public will want to search by area (postcode or street name).</li>
        <li>LPA's need to see a boundary on a map to confirm the gain site area.</li>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">User needs</h2>
      <p>As an LPA I need to see what biodiversity gain sites are allocated to a particular development so that I can approve the net gain plan.</p>
