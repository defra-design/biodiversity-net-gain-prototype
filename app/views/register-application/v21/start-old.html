<p>Use this service to manage biodiversity gains in England as part of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/biodiversity-net-gain">biodiversity net gain (BNG)</a>.</p>
<p>You can:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>register a biodiversity gain site</li>
  <li>record off-site biodiversity gains for a development project</li>
  <li>record habitats being used for off-site gain by a development project at the same as registering a biodiversity gain site</li>
</ul>

<p>If you're a land manager you can use your land and register a biodiversity gain site. You'll be able to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/sell-biodiversity-units-as-a-land-manager">sell the biodiversity units</a> on your biodiversity gain site. </p>

<p>Development projects can buy the biodiversity units and use them as off-site gains to meet the minimum 10% BNG. Development projects are legally required to record their off-site gains using this service.</p> 

<p>We will add approved biodiversity gain sites and linked development projects to the <a href="/register-application/{{ pageURL }}/start-public-register">BNG public register</a>.</p>
