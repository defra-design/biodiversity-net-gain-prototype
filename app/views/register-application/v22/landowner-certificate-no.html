      <p>You need to upload a file proving land ownership if you want to register a biodiversity gain site. For example, an official copy of the title deeds or the lease agreement.</p>

      <p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-information-about-property-and-land/search-the-register">order official copies of land ownership documents</a> from HM Land Registry.</p>

      <p>Your file can be a DOC, DOCX or PDF. It must not be larger than 50MB.</p>
