  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>register a biodiversity gain site</li>
    <li>record off-site biodiversity gains for a development project</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Register a biodiversity gain site</h2>

  <p>Register biodiversity gain sites in England. The biodiversity units on the gain site can be used by development projects which need to meet at least 10% biodiversity net gain. </p>
  <p>Anyone who owns or leases land can register a biodiversity gain site. Someone can do it on the landowner's behalf if they have their consent to register.  </p>

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">What you'll need to register a biodiversity gain site</h3>

  <p>You'll need:</p>

  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>consent from the landowner or leaseholder - if needed</li>
    <li>a planning obligation (S106 agreement) or conservation covenant securing the site for at least 30 years</li>

    <li>a map showing the boundary of the biodiversity gain site</li>
    <li>a completed Biodiversity Metric 4.0</li>

  </ul>

  <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Record off-site biodiversity gains for a development project</h2>

  <p>By law, you have to record any off-site biodiversity gains you plan to use for your development project. You'll need to meet at least a 10% biodiversity net gain. Local planning authorities will set the exact percentage of net gain needed. </p>
  <p>You will not be able to discharge a BNG pre-commencement planning condition with a local planning authority until this has been done.</p>

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">What you'll need to record off-site biodiversity gains for a development project </h3>
