  <h1 class="govuk-heading-l">Register a biodiversity gain site</h1>

  <p>Register biodiversity gain sites in England. A registered biodiversity gain site is land that development projects can use for their off-site gain. These off-site gains contribute to the minimum 10% <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/understanding-biodiversity-net-gain">biodiversity net gain (BNG)</a> needed by development projects.</p>
  <p>Anyone who owns or leases land can register a biodiversity gain site. Someone can do it on the landowner's behalf if they have their consent to register.  </p>

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">What you'll need to register a biodiversity gain site</h3>

  <p>You'll need:</p>

  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li><a href="#">consent from the landowner or leaseholder</a></li>
    <li>a <a href="#">conservation covenant</a> that secures the site for at least 30 years</li>
    <li>proof of ownership of the land</li>
    <li>a map showing the boundary of the biodiversity gain site</li>
    <li>a completed <a href="#">Biodiversity Metric 4.0</a></li>
    <li>a <a href="#">habitat management and monitoring plan</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p>We will check that the biodiversity gain site details submitted are all correct. If everything is correct we will add it to the <a href="#">BNG public register</a>.</p>
