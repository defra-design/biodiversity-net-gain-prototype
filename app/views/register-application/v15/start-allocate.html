<p>Development projects are legally required to use this service to record off-site gains. Any new development will need to meet at least a 10% biodiversity net gain.</p>

<p>We will check the information you record. This is to avoid allocating the same habitat on a biodiversity gain site to multiple developers. You'll need to have written consent from the biodiversity gain site owners.</p>
  
<p>Local planning authorities will not discharge a BNG pre-commencement planning condition until the off-site gains have been recorded.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">What you'll need to record off-site biodiversity gains for a development project
</h3>

<p>If you're using habitat on a registered biodiversity gain site. You'll need:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>the Biodiversity Metric 4.0 file that your local planning authority reviewed with your Biodiversity Net Gain Statement</li>
  <li>to have written consent from the biodiversity gain site owners</li>
