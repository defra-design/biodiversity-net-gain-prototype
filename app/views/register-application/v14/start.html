  <p>Use this service to record biodiversity gains in England. </p>

  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>register a biodiversity gain site</li>
    <li>record off-site biodiversity gains for a development project</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Register a biodiversity gain site</h2>

  <p>Register biodiversity gain sites in England. Once registered, development projects will be able to use it as off-site land to meet at least 10% biodiversity net gain.</p>
  <p>Anyone who owns or leases land can register a biodiversity gain site. Someone can do it on the landowner's behalf if they have their consent to register.  </p>

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">What you'll need to register a biodiversity gain site</h3>

  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

  <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Record off-site biodiversity gains for a development project</h2>

  <p>By law, development projects have to record any off-site biodiversity gains they plan to use. Development projects need to meet at least a 10% biodiversity net gain. Local planning authorities will set the exact percentage of net gain needed.</p>
  <p>Local planning authorities will not discharge the BNG pre-commencement planning conditions until the off-site gains have been recorded.</p>

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">What you'll need to record off-site biodiversity gains for a development project </h3>
