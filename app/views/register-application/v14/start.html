  <p>Use this service to record biodiversity gains in England. </p>

  <p>You can:</p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>register a biodiversity gain site</li>
    <li>record off-site biodiversity gains for a development project</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Register a biodiversity gain site</h2>

  <p>Register biodiversity gain sites in England. A registered biodiversity gain site is land that development projects can use for their off-site gain. These off-site gains contribute to the minimum 10% biodiversity net gain (BNG) needed by development projects.</p>
  <p>Anyone who owns or leases land can register a biodiversity gain site. Someone can do it on the landowner's behalf if they have their consent to register.  </p>

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">What you'll need to register a biodiversity gain site</h3>

  <p>You'll need:</p>

  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li><a href="#">consent from the landowner or leaseholder</a></li>
    <li>a <a href="#">conservation covenant</a> that secures the site for at least 30 years</li>
    <li>proof of ownership of the land</li>
    <li>a map showing the boundary of the biodiversity gain site</li>
    <li>a completed <a href="#">Biodiversity Metric 4.0</a></li>
    <li>a <a href="#">habitat management and monitoring plan</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p>We will check that the biodiversity gain site details submitted are all correct. If everything is correct we will add it to the <a href="#">BNG public register</a>.</p>

  <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Record off-site biodiversity gains for a development project</h2>

  <p>Development projects are legally required to use this service to record off-site gains. Any new development will need to meet at least a 10% biodiversity net gain.</p>

  <p>We will check the information you record. This is to avoid allocating the same habitat on a biodiversity gain site to multiple developers. You'll need to have written consent from the biodiversity gain site owners.</p>
    
  <p>Local planning authorities will not discharge a BNG pre-commencement planning condition until the off-site gains have been recorded.</p>

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">What you'll need to record off-site biodiversity gains for a development project
  </h3>

  <p>If you're using habitat on a registered biodiversity gain site. You'll need:</p>

  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>the Biodiversity Metric 4.0 file that your local planning authority reviewed with your Biodiversity Net Gain Statement</li>
    <li>to have written consent from the biodiversity gain site owners</li>
  </ul>
