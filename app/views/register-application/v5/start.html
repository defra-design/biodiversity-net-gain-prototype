      <p class="govuk-body">You need to provide a legal agreement that links habitat enhancement on the land to a development site. </p>

      <p class="govuk-body">The legal agreement can be a conservation covenant or a planning obligation.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">The legal agreement needs to include the following:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>
          the land is in England
        </li>
        <li>
          the landowner or tenant has rights to the land
        </li>
        <li>
          the person or organisation responsible for the enhancement is considered fit and proper
        </li>
        <li>
          the enhancement began 30 January 2020 or later 
        </li>
        <li>
          the enhancement will be maintained for at least 30 years
        </li>
        <li>
          the enhancement is measured using a biodiversity metric against a baseline
        </li>
        <li>
          the enhancement follows rules on additionality and stacking including on protected sites
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">You will also need to:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>
          upload your completed biodiversity metric 3.0 calculations 
        </li>
        <li>
          upload your management and monitoring plan
        </li>
        <li>
          tell Defra about the landowner and third parties who have an interest in the land
        </li>
        <li>
          provide the boundary of the land
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">It costs £? and can be paid by debit or credit card or Bacs.  </p>
